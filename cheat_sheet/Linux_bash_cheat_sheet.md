# ` `Cheat Sheet  
(works with about every distribution, except for apt-get which is Ubuntu/Debian exclusive) 

Legend: 

Everything in “<>” is to be replaced, ex: <fileName> --> iLovePeanuts.txt Don't include the '=' in your commands 

'..' means that more than one file can be affected with only one command ex: rm file.txt file2.txt movie.mov .. .. 

Linux Bash Shell Cheat Sheet 

Basic Commands 
## Basic Terminal Shortcuts 
CTRL L = Clear the terminal 

CTRL D = Logout 

SHIFT Page Up/Down = Go up/down the terminal CTRL A = Cursor to start of line 

CTRL E = Cursor the end of line 

CTRL U = Delete left of the cursor

Linux Bash Shell Cheat Sheet 

Basic Commands 
## Researching Files 
### The slow method (sometimes very slow): 
locate <text> = search the content of all the files locate <fileName> = search for a file 

sudo updatedb = update database of files 

find = the best file search tool(fast) 

find -name “<fileName>” 

find -name “text” = search for files who start with the word text find -name “\*text” = “  “  “  “  end  “  “  “  “ 
### Advanced Search: 
## Extract, sort and filter data 
grep <someText> <fileName> = search for text in file 

-i = Doesn't consider uppercase words 

-I = exclude binary files 

grep -r <text> <folderName>/ = search for file names 

with occurrence of the text 

With regular expressions: 

grep -E ^<text> <fileName> = search start of lines with the word text 

grep -E <0-4> <fileName> =shows lines containing numbers 0-4 

grep -E <a-zA-Z> <fileName> = retrieve all lines with alphabetical letters 

Linux Bash Shell Cheat Sheet 

Basic Commands 

Search from file Size (in ~) 

find ~ -size +10M = search files bigger than.. (M,K,G)  sort = sort the content of files 

sort <fileName> = sort alphabetically 

Search from last access  sort -o <file> <outputFile> = write result to a file 

find -name “<filetype>” -atime -5  sort -r <fileName> = sort in reverse 

('-' = less than, '+' = more than and nothing = exactly)  sort -R <fileName> = sort randomly 

sort -n <fileName> = sort numbers 

Search only files or directory’s 

find -type d --> ex: find /var/log -name "syslog" -type d  wc = word count 

find -type f = files  wc <fileName> = nbr of line, nbr of words, byte size -l (lines), -w (words), -c (byte size), -m 

More info: man find, man locate  (number of characters) 

cut = cut a part of a file 

-c --> ex: cut -c 2-5 names.txt 

(cut the characters 2 to 5 of each line) 

-d (delimiter)  (-d & -f good for .csv files) -f (# of field to cut) 

more info: man cut, man sort, man grep 

Linux Bash Shell Cheat Sheet 

Basic Commands 
## Time settings 
date = view & modify time (on your computer) 

View: 

date “+%H” --> If it's 9 am, then it will show 09 date “+%H:%M:%Ss” = (hours, minutes, seconds) 

%Y = years 

Modify: 

` `MMDDhhmmYYYY 

Month | Day | Hours | Minutes | Year 

sudo date 031423421997 = March 14th  1997, 23:42 
## Execute programs at another time 
use 'at' to execute programs in the future 

Step 1, write in the terminal: at <timeOfExecution> ENTER ex --> **at 16:45** or **at 13:43 7/23/11** (to be more precise) or after a certain delay: 

at now +5 minutes (hours, days, weeks, months, years) 

Step 2: <ENTER COMMAND> ENTER 

repeat step 2 as many times you need Step 3: CTRL D to close input 

atq = show a list of jobs waiting to be executed 

atrm = delete a job n°<x> 

ex (delete job #42) --> atrm 42 

sleep = pause between commands 

with ';' you can chain commands, ex: touch file; rm file you can make a pause between commands (**m**inutes, **h**ours, **d**ays) ex --> touch file; sleep 10; rm file <-- 10 seconds 
### (continued) 
crontab = execute a command regularly 

-e = modify the crontab 

-l = view current crontab 

-r = delete you crontab 

In crontab the syntax is 

<Minutes> <Hours> <Day of month> <Day of week (0-6, 0 = Sunday)> <COMMAND>

ex, create the file movies.txt every day at 15:47: 47 15 \* \* \* touch /home/bob/movies.txt \* \* \* \* \* --> every minute at 5:30 in the morning, from the 1st to 15th each month: 

30 5 1-15 \* \* 

at midnight on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays: 0 0 \* \* 1,3,4 

every two hours: 

0 \*/2 \* \* \* 

every 10 minutes Monday to Friday: 

\*/10 \* \* \* 1-5 
## Execute programs in the background 
Add a '&' at the end of a command 

ex --> cp bigMovieFile.mp4 & 

nohup: ignores the HUP signal when closing the console (process will still run if the terminal is closed) 

ex --> nohup cp bigMovieFile.mp4 

jobs = know what is running in the background 

fg = put a background process to foreground 

ex: fg (process 1), f%2 (process 2) f%3, ... 

Linux Bash Shell Cheat Sheet 

Basic Commands 
## Process Management 
w = who is logged on and what they are doing 

tload = graphic representation of system load average 

(quit with CTRL C) 

ps = Static process list 

-ef --> ex: ps -ef | less 

-ejH --> show process hierarchy -u --> process's from current user 

top = Dynamic process list While in top: 

- q to close top 
- h to show the help 
- k to kill a process 

CTRL C to top a current terminal process 

kill = kill a process 

You need the PID # of the process 

ps -u <AccountName> | grep <Application> Then 

kill <PID> .. .. .. 

kill -9 <PID> = violent kill 

killall = kill multiple process's 

ex --> killall locate 

extras: 

sudo halt <-- to close computer sudo reboot <-- to reboot 
## Create and modify user accounts 
sudo adduser bob = root creates new user 

sudo passwd <AccountName> = change a user's password sudo deluser <AccountName> = delete an account 

addgroup friends = create a new user group delgroup friends = delete a user group 

usermod -g friends <Account> = add user to a group usermod -g bob boby = change account name 

usermod -aG friends bob = add groups to a user with- out loosing the ones he's already in 

File Permissions 

chown = change the owner of a file 

ex --> chown bob hello.txt 

chown user:bob report.txt = changes the user owning report.txt to 'user' and the group owning it to 'bob' -R = recursively affect all the sub folders 

ex --> chown -R bob:bob /home/Daniel 

chmod = modify user access/permission – simple way 

u = user 

g = group o = other 

d = directory (if element is a directory) l = link (if element is a file link) 

r = read (read permissions) 

w = write (write permissions) 

x = eXecute (only useful for scripts and programs) 

Linux Bash Shell Cheat Sheet 

Basic Commands 
### File Permissions (continued) 
'+' means add a right '-' means delete a right '=' means affect a right 

ex --> chmod g+w someFile.txt 

(add to current group the right to modify someFile.txt) 

more info: man chmod 
## Flow redirection 
Redirect results of commands: 

'>' at the end of a command to redirect the result to a file 

ex --> ps -ejH > process.txt 

'>>' to redirect the result to the end of a file 
### Redirect errors: 
'2>' at the end of the command to redirect the result to a file ex --> cut -d , -f 1 file.csv > file 2> errors.log 

'2>&1' to redirect the errors the same way as the standard output 

Read progressively from the keyboard <Command> << <wordToTerminateInput> 

ex --> sort << END <-- This can be anything you want 

- Hello 
- Alex 
- Cinema 
- Game 
- Code 
- Ubuntu 
- END 
### Flow Redirection (continued) 
terminal output: Alex 

Cinema 

Code 

Game 

Ubuntu 

Another example --> wc -m << END 
## Chain commands 
'|' at the end of a command to enter another one 

ex --> du | sort -nr | less 
## Archive and compress data 
Archive and compress data the long way: 

Step 1, put all the files you want to compress in the same folder: ex --> mv \*.txt folder/ 

Step 2, Create the tar file: 

tar -cvf my\_archive.tar folder/ 

-c : creates a .tar archive 

-v : tells you what is happening (verbose) 

-f : assembles the archive into one file 

Step 3.1, create gzip file (most current): gzip my\_archive.tar 

to decompress: gunzip my\_archive.tar.gz 

Step 3.2, or create a bzip2 file (more powerful but slow): bzip2 my\_archive.tar 

to decompress: bunzip2 my\_archive.tar.bz2 

Linux Bash Shell Cheat Sheet 

Basic Commands 
## Archive and compress data (continued)  Installing software 
step 4, to decompress the .tar file:  When software is available in the repositories: 

` `tar -xvf archive.tar archive.tar  sudo apt-get install <nameOfSoftware> 

ex--> sudo apt-get install aptitude 

Archive and compress data the fast way: 

If you download it from the Internets in .gz format gzip: tar -zcvf [my_archive.tar.gz](https://my_archive.tar.gz) folder/  (or bz2) - “Compiling from source” 

decompress: tar -zcvf [my_archive.tar.gz](https://my_archive.tar.gz) Documents/  Step 1, create a folder to place the file: 

mkdir /home/username/src <-- then cd to it bzip2: tar -jcvf  [my_archive.tar.gz](https://my_archive.tar.gz) folder/ 

decompress: tar -jxvf archive.tar.bz2 Documents/  Step 2, with 'ls' verify that the file is there 

(if not, mv ../file.tar.gz /home/username/src/) Show the content of .tar, .gz or .bz2  without decompressing it: 

Step 3, decompress the file (if .zip: unzip <file>) gzip:  <--

gzip -ztf [archive.tar.gz](https://archive.tar.gz)  Step 4, use 'ls', you should see a new directory bzip2:  Step 5, cd to the new directory 

bzip2 -jtf archive.tar.bz2  Step 6.1, use ls to verify you have an INSTALL file, tar:  then: more INSTALL 

tar -tf archive.tar  If you don't have an INSTALL file: 

Step 6.2, execute **./configure** <-- creates a makefile tar extra:  Step 6.2.1, run make <-- builds application binaries tar -rvf archive.tar file.txt = add a file to the .tar  Step 6.2.2 : switch to root --> su 

Step 6.2.3 : make install <-- installs the software You can also directly compress a single file and view the file  Step 7, read the readme file 

without decompressing:  ![](Aspose.Words.82c43085-0a77-43ae-a3ee-f74c527ba0db.002.png)

Step 1, use gzip or bzip2 to compress the file:  

gzip numbers.txt  

Step 2, view the file without decompressing it:  

zcat = view the entire file in the console (same as cat)  ![](Aspose.Words.82c43085-0a77-43ae-a3ee-f74c527ba0db.003.png)

zmore = view one screen at a time the content of the file (same as more)  zless = view one line of the file at a time (same as less)
